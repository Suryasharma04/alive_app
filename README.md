# Alive
Alive is an app built for concert lovers to relive their favorite moments and discover new ones. Explore artists' current and past tours, complete with detailed setlists from specific nights. Each setlist page features a live video section where users can watch and share videos from that concert, along with other show details. Fans can contribute by adding or editing setlists from the dates and venues they attended, creating a collaborative and interactive experience. Alive goes beyond traditional setlist apps by incorporating live video integration and a vibrant, social community for music enthusiasts.

Note: This is a class project developed by George Bailey, Surya Sharma, and Brooke Wilson under the guidance of Dr. John Barr at Ithaca College.
